In order to successfully complete your main [GIT assignment](git.md), you need to have a solid understanding of key CSS concepts. These principles of web design not only enhance the aesthetics of your resume but also lay the foundation for efficient collaborative workflows in your future professional journey.

## Core CSS Concepts

Below are the crucial CSS concepts that you should familiarize yourself with:

1. **CSS Custom Properties (Variables)** - By leveraging the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in CSS, you can maintain [CSS variables](vars.md) for cleaner and more manageable code, an essential aspect when handling Pull Requests in your assignment.

2. **CSS Layout Techniques** - Understanding [CSS flexbox](flex.md) and [grid systems](grid.md) will empower you to create intricate and beautifully aligned layouts, a critical requirement while designing the layout of your resume.

3. **Media Queries** - Mastery over [responsive designs](responsive.md) with media queries is vital to ensure your websites are adaptable across different devices, a key requirement for this assignment and your future web development projects.

4. **CSS Calc Function** - The [CSS `calc()` function](calc.md) lets you perform calculations directly within your CSS properties. This feature is useful for dynamically maintaining relationships between properties and for finessing your design.

5. **Pseudo-classes** - Enhance the interactivity of your webpage by styling elements based on their state or position in the document. Pseudo-classes such as `:last-child` and `:hover` will be of significant use in this assignment.
